    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm <b>Abhay</b>. l'm a software
        engineer passionate about technology,
        coding. I explore
        the intersection of lifestyle and tech,
        sharing insights into software engineering
        personal projects, and the importance of
        maintaining a balanced life. Work-life
        balance is a strong value of mine, and
        through my channel, I aim to show that it's
        possible to thrive in your career while
        making time for other important aspects in
        your life--whether that's pursuing hobbies
        spending time with friends & family, or just
        taking a moment to recharge. My goal is to
        provide transparency into the software
        engineering career path, spark creativity,
        and empower others to build a fulfilling
        career and life they're passionate about.
        Let's build, learn, and grow together!</p>
